# Unix Shell

This project is done, but does not pass the tests. The assignment, technically, was to create a shell - which I did. Unfortunately, I didn't realize (because the instructions didn't specify) that the assignment was to create a shell for a _normal, \*nix OS_. Since the course placed so much emphasis on xv6, I instead assumed that the assignment was to create a shell _for xv6_. So that's what I did!

My shell does technically meet the project specs (just, you know, within xv6), so I'm counting this project as finished. Let this repo forever stand as a monument to my underdeveloped reading comprehension skills.
