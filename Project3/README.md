# Unix Shell

This project is done, but does not pass the tests. Why doesn't it pass the tests you ask? Well, because the assignment is technically to create a shell, which I did. Unfortunately, I didn't realize the assignment was to create a shell. I instead thought that the assignment was to create a shell _within xv6_. This was, needless to say, a bit more of an undertaking. On the upside, my xv6 shell does meet the project spec, so I'm counting this project as done :)
